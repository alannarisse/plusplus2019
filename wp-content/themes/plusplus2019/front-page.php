				<h2>What  you can  do with PlusPlus</h2>
				<h3>Scale informal face-to-face, peer-to-peer learning.</h3>
				<p>Our platform exposes your "know who" network and expands learning and development opportunities across your organization. Anyone can discover and plan to attend informal brown bag presentations given by one of your senior or long-term employees. Learning and Development can see which topics, which teachers, and more are in demand. People teams or HR can identify employees who might be unaware of training key to their career development.</p>

			<h3>Close your "know how" gap.</h3>

			<p>Just like no two individuals learn the same way, neither do organizations. Unlike monolithic learning management systems, our platform lets employees also choose live events where all examples and references are specific to your organization. Create a culture of coaching and intense development where employees have the opportunity to do what they do best every day. Deliver the right training to the right people at the right time.</p>

			<h3>Retain your employees.</h3>
			<p>Our platform is flexible, designed to guide organizations like yours through all states of cultural change. With add-on modules, such as <a href="#">Coaching</a>, go beyond training employees for
			today's work and relying on individual managers for career development. Grow and scale early
			employees. Increase employee engagement and satisfaction by investing in your employees
			and developing them for the work they aspire to do.</p>

				<h2>What Customers Have Done with PlusPlus</h2>

				<h3>Peer Learning</h3>
				<p>Face-to-face live learning from peers is the most effective way to transfer tribal knowledge. Tribal knowledge, or "know how," is knowledge gained from time spent at your organization within a specific context and specific roles. PlusPlus increases the personal impact of eager engineering staff at Shopify by providing tools to scale their unofficial lunch-and-learns and spontaneous training sessions.</p>

				<h3>Whole Person Development</h3>
				<p>At Shopify, anyone, at any level—not just executives, can sign up for coaching sessions as often as they want. Without the automation provided by the PlusPlus platform, they'd be unable to offer 1000s of coaching sessions globally per year eliminating physical location as a barrier. Delivering what's good for people, in addition to just what's profitable for their organization, gives Shopify a competitive advantage.</p>

				<h3>A Culture of Learning</h3>
				<p>Vibrant engineering cultures that attract, grow, and empower world-class talent take care and feeding. SSENSE increased employee engagement by balancing external conferences and classes with peer-to-peer learning. They ask everyone who attends conferences to host live sessions distilling what they've learned. This fosters a sense of teamwork, team spirit, and inter-team collaborations.</p>

				The wellbeing ingredient is something that sets coaching at Shopify apart from what may be
				offered in other companies. The coaches want to develop the whole person, not just the person
				who comes to work. It's a dual situation – helping with the work problems as well as the how:
				How can I be my best self at work in a way that's healthy for me?</blockquote>
				<cite>Rene Moortgat, Talent Development Operations Specialist at Shopify</cite>

				<blockquote>
				For most engineers, a one-hour session at a conference about the specifics of how to use a
				technology is far less valuable than learning how that particular concept is applied at your
				company. SSENSE University is a great way to train folks on new tools that we've adopted, as
				well as an opportunity to make a case for different tooling.
